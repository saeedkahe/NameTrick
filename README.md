Helloüëã <br>
We are together with a transform exercise.‚ù§Ô∏è<br>
In this exercise, we will get to know the following values.<br>
<h3>transform origin</h3> 
<h3> transform rotate</h3>
<h3>transform skew</h3>
Well, first we create our own HTML file.<br>
Then we make a span tag with the number of letters we want.<br>
Now we create a before and after for each tag so that they are exactly on top of each other.<br>
After that, we value our bifur with transform skew value.<br>
After that, we set after with our own transform rotate value.<br>
Well, only hover remains.<br>
We say that when our tag is hovered, all the values will return to the original state.<br> 
It's that simple!<br>
